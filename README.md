# Jester
Jester is a mod (in progress) for Kingdom Come: Deliverance, its main goal being some sort of swiss army knife.


## Extra Requirements
After cloning you must pull in the submodules, generally this is done through `git submodule update --remote --init --recursive`.
The mod itself requires [KCDFW](/icecubetray/kcdfw) to be installed during runtime.


## Requirements, Building, and Installing
See the sections in the [KCDFW README.md](/icecubetray/kcdfw/blob/master/README.md).
